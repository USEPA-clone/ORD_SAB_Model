## Project Description
The Office of Research and Development has released a publicly available dataset of community
water system (CWS) service area boundaries (SAB). CWS are defined as systems that provide
water for human consumption through pipes or other constructed conveyances to at least 15 service
connections or serves an average of at least 25 people year-round [1]. Under the safe drinking water
act (SDWA) and various drinking water rules (see EPA Drinking Water Regulations) public water
systems must test and report on the quality of their drinking water. These boundaries enable
linking SDWA violations to their associated geographic areas, and concomitantly linking treated
community water system water to their respective customers. This service area boundary dataset is
a combination of publicly available service area boundaries and modeled boundaries. This repository
documents how the data was collected and modeled and details the modeling techniques used to
generate this dataset. All R scripts used in the production of the dataset are available here.
